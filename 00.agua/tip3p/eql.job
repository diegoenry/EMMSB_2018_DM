GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2019.3
Executable:   /home/dgomes/software/gmx2019.3/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /home/dgomes/software/gmx2019.3
Working dir:  /home/dgomes/water_md/tip3p
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -deffnm eql

The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
