GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2019.3
Executable:   /home/dgomes/software/gmx2019.3/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /home/dgomes/software/gmx2019.3
Working dir:  /home/dgomes/water_md/spce
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -deffnm eql


Back Off! I just backed up eql.log to ./#eql.log.3#
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
Reading file eql.tpr, VERSION 2019.3 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 1 to 1.098

Using 8 OpenMP threads 


Back Off! I just backed up eql.xtc to ./#eql.xtc.2#

Back Off! I just backed up eql.edr to ./#eql.edr.2#
starting mdrun 'spce in water'
