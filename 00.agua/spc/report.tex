\section{Methods}
\subsection{Simulation system}
A system of 884 molecules (2652 atoms) was simulated.

\subsection{Simulation settings}
A total of 10 ns were simulated with a time step of 2 fs.
Neighbor searching was performed every 10 steps.
The PME algorithm was used for electrostatic interactions.
with a cut-off of 1 nm.
A reciprocal grid of 28 x 28 x 28 cells was used with 4th order B-spline interpolation.
A single cut-off of 1 nm was used for Van der Waals interactions.
Temperature coupling was done with the Nose-Hoover algorithm.
Pressure coupling was done with the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm.
